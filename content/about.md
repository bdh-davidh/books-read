This site is a record of the books I've read. I've long thought of myself as a reader, but, before this site, I never recorded how many books I read, if I enjoyed them, or how much fiction or non-fiction I've been reading.

My ratings are tough by design. Here's a guide:

<div style="display: flex;gap: 1em;"><p><strong>One star</strong> means a book is pretty rubbish. I may not have finished itâ€” I will note if this is the case. Not worth the time required to read it.{{< rating "1" >}} </p></div>
<div style="display: flex;gap: 1em;"> <p><strong>Two stars</strong> means a book is OK, nothing more. I probably had to put some effort in to complete it. I would not read it again.</p>{{< rating "2" >}}</div>
<div style="display: flex;gap: 1em;"> <p><strong>Three stars</strong> means a book is good - consider it recommended. I would read it again, but it's probably not going to change my life.</p>{{< rating "3" >}}</div>
<div style="display: flex;gap: 1em;"> <p><strong>Four stars</strong> means a book is great. I thought about reading it when I wasn't, and would look forward to getting back to it. I would definitely read it again.</p>{{< rating "4" >}}</div>
<div style="display: flex;gap: 1em;"><p><strong>Five stars</strong> means a book is practically perfect in every way. When I wasn't reading it, all I wanted to be doing was reading it.</p>{{< rating "5" >}} </div>
