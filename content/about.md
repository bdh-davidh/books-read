This site is a record of the books I've read. I've long thought of myself as a reader, but, before this site,  I never recorded how many books I read, if I enjoyed them, or how much fiction or non-fiction I've been reading. 

My ratings are tough by design. Here's a guide:

One star means a book is pretty rubbish.

Two stars means a book is OK, nothing more. I had to put some effort in to complete it.

Three stars means a book is good - consider it recommended. 

Four stars means a book is great. I probably thought about reading it during the day. 

Five stars means a book is amazing. It kept me awake, and I couldn't stop reading it.
