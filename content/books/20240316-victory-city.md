Maybe I missed something here, but this book just didn't work for me. It almost felt to me like an outline of a book, without the flesh and depth that have made the author's writing a joy for me to read in the past. I made it though about 300 of the 384 pages, and, once I'd got over not finishing it, all I felt was relief.  I'm going to give Midnight's Children, which I remember loving, another try and see what I make of it this time.
