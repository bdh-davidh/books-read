review: "A great continuation, with nicely evolving characters"
---
An enjoyable read, not a classic or unput-downable, but a good page turning, with a dramatic but pretty improbably ending (honestly, I didn't really ming though). I love the now slightly dated references to technology that I can relate to! I have to say though that while for it's time it was ahead of the curve, the pre-woke era, I found that the P.C. nature of some of the characters and writing a bit 'on the nose', and slips into easy caricatures. But a nice continuation and development of the first story in the series and I'm looking forward to reading the final instalment.
