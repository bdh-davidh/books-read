An interesting read. I especially enjoyed both the history and context the author provided for the Brighton bombing, which I can vaguely remember seeing or hearing about on the news (I think â€” I'd have been about seven). I also enjoyed that it tied in nicely with the BBC series 'The Gold', which was also good fun, as the lead detective went on to lead that investigation.
