review: "An interesting account of the history and context of the Brighton bombing."
---

An interesting read. I especially enjoyed both the history and context the author provided for the Brighton bombing, which I can vaguely remember seeing or hearing about on the news (I think â€” I'd have been about seven). The book gave a nice insight into how an organisation like the IRA might work, and how its members would have perceived the UK, and it's government. I also enjoyed that it tied in nicely with the BBC series 'The Gold', which was good fun, as the lead detective went on to lead that investigation.
