Oh the joys of getting back to a simple well written story after the trials of [Victory City]({{< relref "books/20240316-victory-city.md" >}}). I say simple, but I was frequently, surprised and charmed by the turns the story took as the brothers made their way accross America. I felt a real affection for Eli, and his internal turmoil, which developed  wonderfully as the story progressed. An enjoyable, fun read, that was never overwhelmed by the violence it contained.
