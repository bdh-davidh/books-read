The final instalment of the <em>'Karla Triology'</em> that I've thoroughly enjoyed reading this year. Once again, George Smiley starts pulling at a thread that unravels a plot that that slowly emerges over the book's 335 pages. Gradually, piece-by-piece the fog clears as he homes in on the achilles heel of his arch rival. By the end we arrive at a wonderfully understated climax wondering quite how we managed to end up where we did. I really enjoyed this book, and am pleased that the author returned to form, moving on from the faster paced, more exotic [The Honourable Schoolboy]({{< relref "/books/20240614-the-honourable-schoolboy.md">}}), almost meeting the amazingly high standard set at the trilogy's outset in [Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy]({{< relref "/books/20240221-tinker-tailor-soldier-spy.md">}}).
