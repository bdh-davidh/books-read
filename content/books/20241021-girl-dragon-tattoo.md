review: "Great characters, good plot. Just an enjoyable on my second read."

I inherited a copy from a friend's mum who was having a clearout, and thought I'd give this one another read to see how it holds up. Very well is the answer. The characters are wonderfully developed, and great fun. I love the setting, and it seems a great book to read as Autumn is comming on. I love the descriptions of the technology people are using - CD ROMS, CDs, iBooks, but somehow the use of these terms seems to place the story more firmly in the era it was written rather than undermine the narrative. The second of the triology is waiting for me, and I'm looking forward to it.
