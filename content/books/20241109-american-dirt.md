review: "An emotional rollercoaster that forced me to think about migrants as people rather than a political issue."
---

As a work of fiction that offers me a window into a world that I will never experience, this book is a success on every level. At times I found the writing a little <q>on the nose</q>, and some of the plot devices a bit too much, but honestly, that doesn't matter. The book totally gripped me and didn't let go. It forced me to think more deeply about a subject that I had only considered in an abstact way. As a white male living in a comfortable country, I feel like I am absolutely the target audience for this book, and perhaps because of this some of the cultural context is simplified and occasionally I felt like I was engaging with literary clickbait, but I don't care. I hope that I will never think about migrants in the same way after reading this.
