What to say about this book that's not already been said, in a much better way than I could ever put it? This was a third attempt at reading it for me and I loved it, I couldn't put it down. I read many of the paragraphs more than once as there was so much nestled into the few words they contained. Amazing, horrifying and mesmerising.
