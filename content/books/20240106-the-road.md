What to say about this book that's not already been said in a much better way than I could ever put it? This was a third attempt at reading it for me and I loved it, I couldn't put it down. This time something just clicked. I read many of the paragraphs more than once as there was so much nestled into the few words they contained. A brilliant piece of writing and once I've recovered I'll have another go at Blood Meridian (which I've also failed at twice).
