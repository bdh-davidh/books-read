This was a great read. I finished it too late last night. Probably too late to properly enjoy the last few pages, but I didn't want to stop until I'd finished — I had to go back and read the last couple of pages twice. I just loved the ending. I loved the minimal exposition throughout the book — a proper masterpiece of <em>'show, don't tell'</em> writing exemplified with the book's final couple of sentences. An intelligent, thoughtful thriller. I'm looking forward to reading more of John le Carré's work.
