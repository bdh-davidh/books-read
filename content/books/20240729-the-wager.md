I picked this one up at random based on the staff recommendations at our local library. I really enjoyed the well researched depictions and descriptions of life in the British navy and at sea during this period of history. There was a large cast of characters and it is a credit to the author that I never felt lost or wondered who was who, despite the various splits and factions that make up a large part of the story. For once I also appreciated that the book didn't include maps of the locations where the main event took place. This left me with only a rough idea of where the events took place which left me in much the same position as the characters (I looked it up afterwards though!) I wondered if this was intentional. An enjoyable, well researched, excellent read.
