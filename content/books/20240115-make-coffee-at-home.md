A really well thought out and well presented, accessible guide to making better coffee at home. James has a great way of talking about what can be a pretty pretentious subject in a down to earth way. It's encouraged me to rethink a couple of aspects of my brewing process. I didn't realised how much has changed, and how many fads have come and gone in the last 20 years or so of coffee making. Seems everyone is making it up as we go along!
