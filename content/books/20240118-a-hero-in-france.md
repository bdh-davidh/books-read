review: "An atmospheric exploration of life in occupied France during the Second World war."
---

A welcome relief after [The Road]({{< relref "books/20240106-the-road.md" >}}). I enjoyed it but still quite intense in its own right, understated way. I found it more like a series of insights into what life might have been like in occupied France than story a typical narrative arc, but the connections between the sections were well maintained and it never felt disjointed. Another good read from Alan Furst â€”but probably not his best.
