A good fun novel that I really enjoyed. I have a soft spot for books set in India and this one didn't disappoint. There was more going on than I realised and I perhaps should have paid more attention in at the earlier sections of the book to get the most out of its structure. All in all, a great story (perhaps a little long...), but fun characters and one that I might read again as I continue to indulge my soft spot for stories based in India.
