A good fun novel that I really enjoyed. I have a soft spot for books set in India and this one didn't dissapoint. There was more going on than I realised and I perhaps should have paid more attention as I was reading to get the most out of the book's structure. All in all, a great story (perhaps a little long...), but fun characters and one that I might read again as I continue to indulge my soft spot for stories based in India.
