review: "A satisfactory ending to the trilogy that rounds out the story nicely. "
---
Perhaps my favourite one of the three? A satisfactory end the to the triology, if a little over long, but I don't mind indulging the author a little at the end of a trilogy. The plot was engaging as always, but the writing style did start to grate on me a little. I'm not sure why I needed to know everything a character is doing (what colour bowel they are using to put a specific breakfast cereal in...), but maybe that I'm not appreciating that that's what helped me related to the characters? Anyway a good read that covered my holiday and helped pass a couple of long train journeys nicely.
