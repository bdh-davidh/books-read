An interesting and insightful book from someone who operated at the highest levels of al-Qaeda. I picked this book up after hearing his story serialised on a podcast. The authors do a good job of not sensationalising the activities, while retaining enough description to remain engaging. It's is a non-fiction book, that deals with a serious topic, but the podcast may have led me to expect a more <em>'entertaining'</em> read. On reflection, the book is better off as it is: a serious, factual account without any unnecessary window-dressing.
