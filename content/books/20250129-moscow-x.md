review: "An enjoyable, up-to-date, thriller, slightly let down by stereotypical characters"
---
My second book by this author, and, this one wasn't quite as good as the first. The plot ticks along nicely, and it's refreshing to read a spy thriller that's so up-to-date. But I just can't get past the stereotyped characters that we've all met before: the chief who doesn't play by the rules, the sexy and cleaver spy (undercover as a high flying lawyer), and her rugged handsome parter (own's a stud farm..). That said the authors detailed background information and the insights into this world still made the book worth reading.
