I can't quite put my finger on why I enjoyed this book so much, but I really did. It ticks a long at the steady pace, that I associate with soutern France, never too slow, but not moving too fast either. The pace does notch up a couple of gears in the last part of the book, but by that time I felt like I knew the characters well enough to keep up. I really loved the absolutely horrible character who narratives the story. A massively over-confident, but clearly intelligent women, that seems to be held together by a combination of self-belief and good luck. The book never seemed overly descriptive, but I had, and still have a clear picture in my mind of the locations and places where events took place, which is a credit to the author. Good fun and a great read.
