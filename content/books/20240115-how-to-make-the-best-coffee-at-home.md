A really well-thought-out and presented guide to making better coffee. The author has a great way of talking about what can be a pretty pretentious subject in a down to earth and accessible manner. It's encouraged me to rethink a couple of aspects of my brewing process. I didn't realise how much has changed, and how many fads have come and gone in the last 20 years or so of coffee making. It's reassuring that everyone is making it up as we go along.
