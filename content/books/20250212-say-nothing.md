I really enjoyed this book. The author succeeded in shepherding me through a complex subject, with a vast cast of real-life characters, while balancing the personal stories of the people impacted with coverage of the broader political changes taking place. This is no small feat to accomplish. This isn't an exhaustive history of what happened but rather an overview of what took place, fleshed out with the histories of some of the key characters involved, and I feel that this book is so much better for it. Highly recommended.
