review: "A gripping account of finance in late 90's Moscow, with a dark underside and consequences."
---
This book wooed me in with tails of financial daring-do in late 90's/early 2000's Moscow, but before I knew it I was reading about corruption, imprisonment and murder. I felt like this book gave me a small sense of the Russion mindset, and perhaps helps me to understand a little about the current situation in the country, and how it arose and has been maintained. I have to admit enjoying the first half of the book more, which covered the author getting established and starting out in Russia. The last quarter, which focuses on efforts to get some kind of justice for one of the author's colleagues is by it's nature least entertaining, but by that time I was sufficiently invested in the characters involved to remain engaged right to the end.
