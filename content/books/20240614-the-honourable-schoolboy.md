The second in the <em>'Karla Triology'</em> that follows on from the wonderful [Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy]({{< relref "/books/20240221-tinker-tailor-soldier-spy.md">}}). This is a long, complicated book that requires attention, and rewards the reader with a great cast of characters and a subtle plot (at times perhaps too subtle?) that crescendos over almost 700 pages to a thrilling climax. The slow build of the story meant that, at times, I could only really understand where I was in the story, not how I'd got there, which I enjoyed. However, whereas in Tinker Tailor the seriousness and impact of the situation was clear from the start, I never really appreciated the value of the <em>'prize'</em> in this book sufficiently to get as emotionally invested as I'd have liked.
