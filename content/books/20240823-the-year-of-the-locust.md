I don't know what happened here. The first 80% of the book was an engaging, thriller, typical of what I would expect from this kind of genre. Actually, not typical, slightly better in fact. I enjoyed the premise, the locations and even the characters. But, and this is a big but, I feel like the author just lost interest in the last 15% of the book. It wasn't the massive genre switch that upset me, which I thought the author pulled off pretty well considering the shift from espionage thriller to science-fiction is not a small leap. But rather the massive plot holes, assumptions and contrivances that came with it. If I hadn't already read about 550 pages I would have stopped reading. The only reasonable explanation I can think of is the author was on a deadline to deliver, and just chucked out whatever passed the increadably low bar set by their editor. A real dissapointment.
