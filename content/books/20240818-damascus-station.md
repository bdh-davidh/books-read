I did enjoy this book, mostly. The plot was good, and didn't require too much of a suspension of disbelief. I liked that the book communicated the context and claustrophobia that I imagine comes with working in a country like Syria, and it appears to give a good portrate of Damascus. That said, the book seemed to be clearly aimed at middle aged, American males, and I did find the lengthy, slightly provocative descriptions of the heroine were laid on a bit thick, but it was nothing I couldn't live with. The book helped pass an eight hour plane journey nicely, and if your in the mood for an engaging and enjoyable thriller that doesn't ask too much of you this would fit the bill nicely.
