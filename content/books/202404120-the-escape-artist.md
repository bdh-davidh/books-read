Honestly, I would have never chosen to read a book about Auschwitz. This book did an amazing trick of giving me an idea me what happened there, and how life was, by focusing on the amazing story of Rudolf Vrba, the first Jew to successfully escape Auschwitz. In a strange way the fact that the horror of the situation wasn't the focus on the book made it all the more disturbing. Absolutely unimaginable things are described as part of every day life. A very good read. I didn't rate it higher, as I felt the final chapters after the escape went on too long.
