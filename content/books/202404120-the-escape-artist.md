Honestly, I would have never chosen to read a book about Auschwitz on purpose, but I'm glad that I ended up reading one. This book did an amazing trick of giving me some idea what happened there through the lens of the amazing life story of Rudolf Vrba, the first Jew to successfully escape from the prison. In a strange way the fact that the horror of the situation wasn't the focus on the book made it all the more disturbing. Absolutely unimaginable things are described as part of every day life. Truely, truely shocking. A very good read. I didn't rate it higher, as I felt the final chapters after the escape went on too long.
