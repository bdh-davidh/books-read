review: "A mostly engaging story covering multiple generations, and multiple locations - perhaps too many?"

I think I'm probably underestimating this book, but while some parts of it engaged me thoughroughly and emotionally, other parts that moved quicker through time, characters and locations left me cold. I really enjoyed the parts where we stayted with a story and character for a while, and the writing drew me in to the story really well, but I almost stopped reading during about three-quarters of the way through as I felt like we were just jumping five years with every chapter between characters I didn't really care about. I'm glad I stuck with the book. I did enjoy it and if that's the price to pay for such an ambitious work then I'm fine with that.
