      <title>The Year of the Locust</title>

      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t know what happened here. The first 80% of the book was an engaging, thriller, typical of what I would expect from this kind of genre. Actually, not typical, slightly better in fact. I enjoyed the premise, the locations and even the characters. But, and this is a big but, I feel like the author just lost interest in the last 15% of the book. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t the massive genre switch that upset me, which I thought the author pulled off pretty well considering the shift from espionage thriller to science-fiction is not a small leap.</description>

      <description>I did enjoy this book, mostly. The plot was good, and didn&amp;rsquo;t require too much of a suspension of disbelief. I liked that the book communicated the context and claustrophobia that I imagine comes with working in a country like Syria, and it appears to give a good portrate of Damascus. That said, the book seemed to be clearly aimed at middle aged, American males, and I did find the lengthy, slightly provocative descriptions of the heroine were laid on a bit thick, but it was nothing I couldn&amp;rsquo;t live with.</description>

      <title>Nine Lives: My Time As MI6&#39;s Top Spy Inside al-Qaeda</title>

      <description>An interesting and insightful book from someone who operated at the highest levels of al-Qaeda. I picked this book up after hearing his story serialised on a podcast. The authors do a good job of not sensationalising the activities, while retaining enough description to remain engaging. It&amp;rsquo;s is a non-fiction book, that deals with a serious topic, but the podcast may have led me to expect a more &amp;lsquo;entertaining&amp;rsquo; read. On reflection, the book is better off as it is: a serious, factual account without any unnecessary window-dressing.</description>

      <description>I picked this one up at random based on the staff recommendations at our local library. I really enjoyed the well researched depictions and descriptions of life in the British navy and at sea during this period of history. There was a large cast of characters and it is a credit to the author that I never felt lost or wondered who was who, despite the various splits and factions that make up a large part of the story.</description>

      <description>The final instalment of the &amp;lsquo;Karla Triology&amp;rsquo; that I&amp;rsquo;ve thoroughly enjoyed reading this year. Once again, George Smiley starts pulling at a thread that unravels a plot that that slowly emerges over the book&amp;rsquo;s 335 pages. Gradually, piece-by-piece the fog clears as he homes in on the achilles heel of his arch rival. By the end we arrive at a wonderfully understated climax wondering quite how we managed to end up where we did.</description>

      <description>The second in the &amp;lsquo;Karla Triology&amp;rsquo; that follows on from the wonderful Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy. This is a long, complicated book that requires attention, and rewards the reader with a great cast of characters and a subtle plot (at times perhaps too subtle?) that crescendos over almost 700 pages to a thrilling climax. The slow build of the story meant that, at times, I could only really understand where I was in the story, not how I&amp;rsquo;d got there, which I enjoyed.</description>

      <description>Honestly, I would have never chosen to read a book about Auschwitz on purpose, but I&amp;rsquo;m glad that I ended up reading one. This book did an amazing trick of giving me some idea what happened there through the lens of the amazing life story of Rudolf Vrba, the first Jew to successfully escape from the prison. In a strange way the fact that the horror of the situation wasn&amp;rsquo;t the focus on the book made it all the more disturbing.</description>

      <description>Oh the joys of getting back to a simple well written story after the trials of Victory City. I say simple, but I was frequently, surprised and charmed by the turns the story took as the brothers made their way accross America. I felt a real affection for Eli, and his internal turmoil, which developed wonderfully as the story progressed. An enjoyable, fun read, that was never overwhelmed by the violence it contained.</description>

      <description>Maybe I missed something here, but this book just didn&amp;rsquo;t work for me. It almost felt to me like an outline of a book, without the flesh and depth that have made the author&amp;rsquo;s writing a joy for me to read in the past. I made it though about 300 of the 384 pages, and, once I&amp;rsquo;d got over not finishing it, all I felt was relief. I&amp;rsquo;m going to give Midnight&amp;rsquo;s Children, which I remember loving, another try and see what I make of it this time.</description>

      <description>I really wanted to like this book, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t. I enjoy the informal tone of Alastair Campbell on his podcast with Rory Stewart, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t warm to it at all in the witten form. I found that 95% of the book was the warm up to what I actually wanted to learn from this book: what I can I to help make politics better in this country. I hope that it serves to motivate people to get involved in politics, but this one wasn&amp;rsquo;t for me.</description>

      <description>This was a great read. I finished it too late last night. Probably too late to properly enjoy the last few pages, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to stop until I&amp;rsquo;d finished — I had to go back and read the last couple of pages twice. I just loved the ending. I loved the minimal exposition throughout the book — a proper masterpiece of &amp;lsquo;show, don&amp;rsquo;t tell&amp;rsquo; writing exemplified with the book&amp;rsquo;s final couple of sentences.</description>

      <description>I have a bit of a man crush on Rory Stewart and was excited to receive this book as my leaving gift. I enjoyed it, although it is a bit of a depressing take on the state of UK politics and the way things work — and things have only got worse since Rory’s time. The book was split into three main acts focusing on: getting elected and representing Cumbria; time spent as junior and then more senior government minister; and Rory’s run for leader of the Conservative Party.</description>

      <description>A really well-thought-out and presented guide to making better coffee. The author has a great way of talking about what can be a pretty pretentious subject in a down to earth and accessible manner. It&amp;rsquo;s encouraged me to rethink a couple of aspects of my brewing process. I didn&amp;rsquo;t realise how much has changed, and how many fads have come and gone in the last 20 years or so of coffee making.</description>

      <description>A welcome relief after The Road. I enjoyed it but still quite intense in its own right, understated way. I found it more like a series of insights into what life might have been like in occupied France than story a typical narrative arc, but the connections between the sections were well maintained and it never felt disjointed. Another good read from Alan Furst —but probably not his best.</description>

      <description>What to say about this book that&amp;rsquo;s not already been said in a much better way than I could ever put it? This was a third attempt at reading it for me and I loved it, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t put it down. This time something just clicked. I read many of the paragraphs more than once as there was so much nestled into the few words they contained. A brilliant piece of writing and once I&amp;rsquo;ve recovered I&amp;rsquo;ll have another go at Blood Meridian (which I&amp;rsquo;ve also failed at twice).</description>

      <description>A good fun novel that I really enjoyed. I have a soft spot for books set in India and this one didn&amp;rsquo;t disappoint. There was more going on than I realised and I perhaps should have paid more attention in at the earlier sections of the book to get the most out of its structure. All in all, a great story (perhaps a little long&amp;hellip;), but fun characters and one that I might read again as I continue to indulge my soft spot for stories based in India.</description>

      <title>Killing Thatcher: The IRA, the Manhunt and the Long War on the Crown</title>

      <description>An interesting read. I especially enjoyed both the history and context the author provided for the Brighton bombing, which I can vaguely remember seeing or hearing about on the news (I think — I&amp;rsquo;d have been about seven). The book gave a nice insight into how an organisation like the IRA might work, and how its members would have perceived the UK, and it&amp;rsquo;s government. I also enjoyed that it tied in nicely with the BBC series &amp;lsquo;The Gold&amp;rsquo;, which was good fun, as the lead detective went on to lead that investigation.</description>
