- rating: One star means a book is pretty rubbish. I may not have finished itâ€” I will note if this is the case. Not worth the time required to read it.
- rating: Two stars means a book is OK, nothing more. I probably had to put some effort in to complete it. I would not read it again.
- rating: Three stars means a book is good - consider it recommended. I would read it again, but it's probably not going to change my life.
- rating: Four stars means a book is great. I thought about reading it when I wasn't, and would look forward to getting back to it. I would definitely read it again.
- rating: Five stars means a book is practically perfect in every way. When I wasn't reading it, all I wanted to be doing was reading it.
